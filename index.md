    <h2>Or Hadas</h2>
    <p>
      I am an atmospheric scientist studying midlatitude climate dynamics, with a focus on interactions across spatial and temporal scales.
      I recently completed my PhD at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

    <p>
      My research combines theory, idealized models, reanalysis data, observations, and machine learning to understand the basic mechanisms driving the midlatitude climate.
