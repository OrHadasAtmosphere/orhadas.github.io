I am an atmospheric scientist studying large-scale atmospheric dynamics, with a focus on storms, jets, and climate.

I recently completed my PhD at the Weizmann Institute of Science. My research combines theory, idealized models, and machine learning to understand variability and predictability in the climate system.

You can find my work on the [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/) page.
