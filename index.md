    <p>
      I am an atmospheric scientist studying midlatitude climate dynamics, with a focus on interactions across spatial and temporal scales.
      I recently completed my PhD at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

      My research combines theory, idealized models, reanalysis data, observations, and machine learning to understand the basic mechanisms driving the midlatitude climate.
