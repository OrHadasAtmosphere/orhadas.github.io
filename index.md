## Or Hadas

I am an atmospheric scientist studying large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere, with a focus on storms, jets, and climate.  
I recently completed my PhD at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

My research combines theory, idealized models, and machine learning to understand variability and predictability in the climate system.
