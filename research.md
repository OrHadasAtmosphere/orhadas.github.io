      <h2>Machine Learning and Predictability of Midlatitude Storms</h2>
      <p>
        I investigate the predictability of midlatitude storm systems using idealized climate configurations and machine learning tools.
        My work focuses on identifying dynamical constraints on storm evolution and understanding how climate background states
        shape storm variability and predictability.
      </p>
      <p>
        By combining interpretable machine learning with physical diagnostics, I aim to quantify the relationship between
        climate structure and storm statistics across parameter regimes.

      <h2>Fundamentals of Midlatitude Dynamics</h2>
      <p>
        My research explores the dynamical mechanisms governing midlatitude circulation, including baroclinic instability,
        jet dynamics, and eddy–mean flow interactions. I study how energy conversion and wave propagation control
        storm growth and atmospheric structure.

      <p>
        This work combines theoretical analysis and idealized modeling to isolate the core physical processes
        shaping midlatitude climate.

      <h2>Midlatitude Clouds–Circulation Coupling</h2>
      <p>
        I examine how cloud processes interact with large-scale circulation and baroclinic activity.
        My work investigates how storm-driven cloud distributions influence planetary albedo
        and how circulation shifts affect cloud radiative properties.

      <p>
        This research bridges atmospheric dynamics and cloud–radiative feedbacks,
        with implications for present and future climate states.
